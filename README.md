# ezscript
Helps speed up the process of installing scripts for faster use
Usage
ezscript <filename>
example:
/root/ezscript /root/Downloads/jtrar.sh

The file will then be installed to /usr/bin/jtrar
so insted of typing
/root/Downloads/jtrar.sh
everytime you can just do
jtrar

Nothing specal will not let you try to install a non existant file
and will not install a already installed file
